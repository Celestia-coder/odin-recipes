        <li class="lists">Cook and stir bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat until evenly browned and crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate and set aside.</li>
        <li class="lists">Beat together eggs and cream in a medium bowl until just blended. Stir in Parmesan cheese and set aside.</li>
        <li class="lists">Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook pasta in boiling water until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and return pasta to the pot.</li>
        <li class="lists">Add softened butter to the pot and toss with pasta until butter is melted. Add bacon and egg-cheese mixture. Stir until the heat of pasta cooks eggs, then garnish with parsley and black pepper to serve.</li>
